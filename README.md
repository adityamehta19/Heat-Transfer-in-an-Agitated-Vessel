# Heat-Transfer-in-an-Agitated-Vessel

This study aims to determine the amount of heat transferred, the overall heat transfer coefficient, and the individual heat transfer coefficient of the inside tube in a heat exchanger system. The system consists of an Agitated Vessel where hot fluid is inside the vessel and transfers heat to a fluid at room temperature flowing inside the copper tube.

## Materials Used

Copper Tube, Agitated Vessel, Impeller (Fan Blades), Agitator Stand, Funnel, Electric Kettle and Thermocouple

## Setup

Our setup includes a simple insulated vessel with hot water inside it and a copper coil that goes in and out of the vessel.

## Process, Methodology and Calculations

We first heated the water to high temperature which we measured using a thermocouple and put into the vessel. Then, we took water at room temperature (again the temperature measured using a thermocouple) to pass it inside the coil from a height h.

Calculations were performed using the equations of heat transfer which are mentioned in the detailed report. Also, the data we got can be accessed from the excel sheet (link provided in the report).

## Results and Discussion

Analysing the Data, we can see that the value of overall heat transfer coefficient increases as increase the speed of the impeller. The increase in the value can be seen the sheet shared above. Also, we can say that if the mass flow rate is increases, the value of the overall heat transfer coefficent will be decreased.

## Conclusions

Concluding the experiment, we can say that by increasing the speed of the impeller (as we increases from 0 to 1500 RPM), the overall heat transfer coefficients increases. This brings changes in the values of hi and ho. Also, by this experiment, we are able to justify the value of the thermal conductivity of copper.
